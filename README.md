Forms &amp; instructions for Co-op employees and contractors

To All Employees, Contractors and Active Members,

The Coop has set-up an email account for all invoices and expense reimbursement forms. The separate
account will insure that Accounting has all expense information in one location to record Coop expenses
and make payments to you on a timely basis. The new email address is: invoices@rchain.coop

Many of you have your own invoices, which can be submitted to the email account as an attachment,
and it is perfectly acceptable to just submit the information right in the email.

Critical data needed by Accounting to record the expense are:
- Name (First and Last)
- Date that work was performed, e.g. November 2017
- Github Project Number if Applicable
- Hours Worked and Rate if Applicable
- Amount Due
- Amount Payable in Rhoc
- Amount Payable in USD, Bitcoin, or Ether
- Rhoc Wallet Address if Applicable
- BTC or Ether Address if Applicable
- Mailing Address for USD Checks

We would like all invoices received by the 2nd day of the month for the prior monthâ€™s work, and we are
planning on sending all payments out by the 7th day of the month.
Please feel free to contact me on Discord (@lisarice27) with any questions.

Thanks!  
Lisa
