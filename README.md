Forms &amp; instructions for Co-op employees and contractors

(republishing Lisa's 12/1/17 email)

Hi Everyone,

The Coop has set-up an email account for all invoices and expense reimbursement forms.  The separate account will insure that Accounting has all expense information in one location to record Coop expenses and make payments to you on a timely basis.  The new email address is:  invoices@rchain.coop

Many of you have your own invoices, which can be submitted to the email account as an attachment, and it is perfectly acceptable to just submit the information right in the email.

Critical data needed by Accounting to record the expense are:

- Name (First and Last)
- Date that work was performed, e.g. November 2017
- Github Project Number (if Applicable)
- Hours Worked and Rate (if Applicable)
- Amount Due

- Amount Payable in Rhoc
- Amount Payable in USD, Bitcoin, or Ether

- Rhoc Wallet Address (if Applicable)
- BTC or Ether Address (if Applicable)
- Mailing Address for USD Checks (the Coop strongly prefers to pay in Rhoc, Eth and BTC.)

We would like all invoices received by the 2nd business day of the month for the prior monthâ€™s work, and we are planning on sending all payments out by the 7th business day of the month. 

If you have not provided a [W9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) (US citizens and any contractor performing work in the U.S.) or a [W8](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) (contractors performing work outside of the U.S.), please send that with your first invoice.  

Please feel free to contact me on Discord or email with any questions.

Lisa
